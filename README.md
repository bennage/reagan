This is a tool for verifying that the code samples embeddeding in a markdown document are in sync with the gitHub-hosted source files.

It is currently hard-coded to work with the [azure/azure-content](https://github.com/azure/azure-content) repo, and then just a subset of articles that I'm interested in.
